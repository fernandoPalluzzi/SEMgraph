Mario Grassi and Barbara Tarantino

This folder contains the following data and files that can be used to
reproduce the analysis of the manuscript. The folder structure can be
summarised as follows:

./Data/:
    
    GSE172114_series_matrix.txt.gz
    GSE172114_rsem_gene_count_matrix_TMM_69samples.csv
    Raw COVID-19 source data

./R/:
    
    Main_sim.R
    An R script to run Data simulations
    
    Main_true.R
    An R script to run True data analysis

    Help.R
    An R script with functions to import for running the analysis

## Note:
1. Set folder SEMgsa_code_data as the current working directory.
2. Specify a smaller number of iterations by argument “N” to
reduce computing time for data simulations.
