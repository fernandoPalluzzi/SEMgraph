\title{Missing edge testing implied by a graph with Shipley's basis-set}
\usage{
Shipley.test(graph, data, MCX2 = FALSE, limit = 30000, verbose = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{A directed graph as an igraph object.}

\item{data}{A data matrix with subjects as rows and variables as
columns.}

\item{MCX2}{If TRUE, a Monte Carlo P-value of the combined C test is enabled.}

\item{limit}{An integer value corresponding to the number of missing
edges of the extracted acyclic graph. Beyond this limit, multicore
computation is enabled to reduce the computational burden.
By default, \code{limit = 30000}.}

\item{verbose}{If TRUE, Shipley's test results will be showed to
screen (default = TRUE).}

\item{...}{Currently ignored.}
}
\value{
A list of three objects: (i) the DAG used to perform the Shipley
test (ii) the list of all d-separation tests over missing edges in the
input graph and (iii) the overall Shipley's' P-value.
}
\description{
Compute all the P-values of the d-separation tests
implied by the missing edges of a given acyclic graph (DAG).
The conditioning set Z is represented, in a DAG, by the union of the
parent sets of X and Y (Shipley, 2000). 
The results of every test, in a DAG, is then combined using the
Fisherâ€™s statistic in an overall test of the fitted model
C = -2*sum(log(P-value(k))), where C is distributed as a chi-squared
variate with df = 2k, as suggested by Shipley (2000).
