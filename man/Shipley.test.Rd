\title{Missing edge testing implied by a graph}
\usage{
Shipley.test(graph, data, limit = NULL, verbose = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{A directed graph as an igraph object.}

\item{data}{A data matrix with subjects as rows and variables as 
columns.}

\item{limit}{An integer value corresponding to the number of missing 
edges of the extracted acyclic graph. Beyond this limit, multicore
computation is enabled to reduce the computational burden. 
By default, \code{limit = NULL} (i.e., multicore disabled).}

\item{verbose}{If TRUE, Shipley's test results will be showed to 
screen (default = TRUE).}

\item{...}{Currently ignored.}
}
\value{
A list of three objects: (i) the list of all d-separation tests 
over missing edges in the input DAG or BAP, (ii) the DAG or BAP 
used to perform the Shipley test, and (iii) the overall Shipley's 
P-value.
}
\description{
Compute all the P-values of the d-separation tests 
implied by the missing edges of a given acyclic graph (DAG or BAP). 
The conditioning set Z is represented, in a DAG, by the union of the 
parent sets of X and Y (Shipley, 2000). In a BAP, Z is the minimal set 
consisting in the smallest conditioning set Z that makes these two 
variables independent. 
The results of every test, in a DAG, is then combined using the 
Fisherâ€™s statistic in an overall test of the fitted model 
C = -2*sum(log(P-value(k))), where C is distributed as a chi-squared 
variate with df = 2k, as suggested by Shipley (2000).
In a BAP, the P-values resulting from every test are corrected by 
multiple testing multiplying by the number of missing edges. The 
smallest one is then considered as the overall test P-value 
(Shipley, 2002).
